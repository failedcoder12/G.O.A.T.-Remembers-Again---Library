Dilworth's theorem states that, in any finite partially ordered set, the largest antichain has the same size as the smallest chain decomposition.

Policy Based data structure

OrderedSet

(Use as multiset)

#include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp> // Common file

#include <ext/pb_ds/tree_policy.hpp>     // Including tree_order_statistics_node_update

using namespace __gnu_pbds;

typedef tree<ll, null_type, less_equal<ll>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update> ordered_set;

order_of_key -> find element less than x

find_order_by -> returns iterator to kth largest element counting from 0.

lower bound works as upper bound


Normal set

typedef tree<ll, null_type, less<ll>, rb_tree_tag, tree_order_statistics_node_update> ordered_set;
  
Fast Hash in cpp

const int RANDOM = chrono::high_resolution_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count();

struct chash { int operator()(int x) const { return x ^ RANDOM; }};

cc_hash_table<int, int, hash<int>> cnt;
